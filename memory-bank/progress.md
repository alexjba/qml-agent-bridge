# Progress

Works:
- Repo scaffolded, builds on macOS.
- WS server: hello (v0.2), list_roots, find_by_name, inspect, list_children, set_property, call_method(with args + return), evaluate, subscriptions (signal/property).
 - Integration test validates end-to-end (including property event with value).

Next:
- Add Python client scaffold and examples.
- Expand call_method to support arguments.
 - Enrich signal events with parameter payloads.

Issues:
- None blocking.
