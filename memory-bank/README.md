This folder captures the durable context for qml-agent-bridge. Read these at the start of every task.

Files:
- projectbrief.md: scope and goals
- productContext.md: why and UX goals
- activeContext.md: current focus and next steps
- systemPatterns.md: architecture and patterns
- techContext.md: stack and constraints
- progress.md: what works, what's next

Process:
1) After significant changes, update activeContext.md and progress.md.
2) When decisions/patterns change, update systemPatterns.md.
3) When scope/vision evolves, update projectbrief.md and productContext.md.

Checklist before implementation sessions:
- Read all files
- Confirm activeContext.md reflects current focus
- Append to progress.md after the session

Versioning:
- Keep entries concise; prefer bullet points.
- Add dates when changing direction.
